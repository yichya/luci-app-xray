# luci-app-xray

Focus on making the most of Xray (HTTP/HTTPS/Socks/TProxy inbounds, multiple protocols support, DNS server, bridge (reverse proxy), even HTTPS proxy server for actual HTTP services) while keeping thin and elegant.

## Warnings

* For security concerns, global SOCKS / HTTP inbound (listen on 0.0.0.0, port 1080 / 1081 by default) is deprecated and will be removed in next major version (4.0.0). 
    * These settings are moved out of main luci app. Select "Preview or Deprecated" in "Extra Settings" tab and reboot to let those settings show again in preview app.
    * Use Extra Inbound to manually add ports (avoid using common ports like 1080, also set listen addresses carefully) and adjust related workloads to use that.
* Since version 3.2.0 sniffing and global custom settings are deprecated. 
    * These features are moved out of main luci app (into preview app). 
    * Global custom settings will be removed in version 4.0.0. Use "Custom Configuration Hook" for global custom settings. 
    * Sniffing might get completely reimplemented later. Use FakeDNS instead of sniffing to avoid incompatibilities.
* This project **DOES NOT SUPPORT** the following versions of OpenWrt because of the requirements of firewall4 and cilent-side rendering LuCI:
    * LEDE / OpenWrt prior to 22.03
    * [Lean's OpenWrt Source](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) (which uses a variant of LuCI shipped with OpenWrt 18.06)

    If this is your case, use Passwall or similar projects instead (you could find links in [XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/)).
* About experimental REALITY support
    * it may change quite frequently (before the release of official documents about the protocol). Keep in mind for (maybe) breaking changes.
* If you see `WARNING: at least one of asset files (geoip.dat, geosite.dat) is not found under /usr/share/xray. Xray may not work properly` and don't know what to do:
    * try `opkg update && opkg install v2ray-geoip v2ray-geosite`
    * if that doesn't work, see [#52](https://github.com/yichya/luci-app-xray/issues/52#issuecomment-856059905)
* This project may change its code structure, configuration files format, user interface or dependencies quite frequently since it is still in its very early stage. 

## Installation (Manually building OpenWrt)

Choose one below:

* Add `src-git-full luci_app_xray https://github.com/yichya/luci-app-xray` to `feeds.conf.default` and run `./scripts/feeds update -a; ./scripts/feeds install -a` 
* Clone this repository under `package`

Then find `luci-app-xray` under `Extra Packages`.

## Installation (Use GitHub actions to build ipks)

Fork this repository and:

* Create a release by pushing a tag
* Wait until actions finish
* Use `opkg -i *` to install both ipks from Releases.
