# luci-app-xray

[luci-app-v2ray](https://github.com/yichya/luci-app-v2ray) refined to client side rendering (and switched to xray as well).

Focus on making the most of Xray (HTTP/HTTPS/Socks/TProxy inbounds, multiple protocols support, DNS server, bridge (reverse proxy), even HTTPS proxy server for actual HTTP services) while keeping thin and elegant.

## Warnings

* Since OpenWrt 22.03 release, the recommended firewall implementation for this project is now **firewall4** with some caveats
    * currently this project still works on OpenWrt 19.07 / 21.02 versions. There's a warning about missing `kmod-nft-tproxy` when using these versions, just ignore it. This problem will be fixed later.
    * support for versions mentioned above will soon be **deprecated**, which means that most new features won't be implemented for these old versions. Check changelog for details about future changes and availability of various new features.
    * there is a possible bug in nftables 1.0.3 / 1.0.4 which breaks tproxy, so if you use master branch, make sure your source code is newer than [36bec544d73dbed46f06875fdfa570e89a40e553](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/36bec544d73dbed46f06875fdfa570e89a40e553)
    * currently building ipk with OpenWrt SDK is **NOT** tested and is **NOT** likely to work right now. If you are building ipks yourself, use the proper version of buildroot toolchain which matches the firewall implementation (fw3 or fw4) you are using.
* There will be a series of **BREAKING CHANGES** in the following months due to some major refactor of DNS module. Please read changelog carefully to know about breaking changes and always backup your configuration files before updating.
* If you see `WARNING: at least one of asset files (geoip.dat, geosite.dat) is not found under /usr/share/xray. Xray may not work properly` and don't know what to do:
    * try `opkg update && opkg install xray-geodata` (at least OpenWrt 21.02 releases)
    * if that doesn't work or you are using OpenWrt 19.07 releases, see [#52](https://github.com/yichya/luci-app-xray/issues/52#issuecomment-856059905)
* This project **DOES NOT SUPPORT** the following versions of OpenWrt due to the fact that client side rendering requires LuCI client side APIs shipped with at least OpenWrt 19.07 releases. 
    * LEDE 17.01
    * OpenWrt 18.06
    * [Lean's OpenWrt Source](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) (which uses a variant of LuCI shipped with OpenWrt 18.06)

    If this is your case, use Passwall or similar projects instead (you could find links in [XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/)).
* For OpenWrt 19.07 releases, you need to prepare your own xray-core package (just download from [Releases · yichya/openwrt-xray](https://github.com/yichya/openwrt-xray/releases) and install that) because building Xray from source requires Go 1.17 which is currently only available in at least OpenWrt 21.02 releases.
* This project may change its code structure, configuration files format, user interface or dependencies quite frequently since it is still in its very early stage. 

## Installation

Clone this repository under `package/extra` and find `luci-app-xray` under `Extra Packages`.

## Changelog 2023

* 2023-01-01 feat: optional restart of dnsmasq on interface change

* 2023-01-23 `[OpenWrt 22.03 or above only]` feat: custom configurations in outbounds. Say if you want to try [XTLS/Xray-core#1540](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/pull/1540) before its release, you can specify `{"streamSettings": {"tlsSettings": {"fingerprint": "xray_random"}}}` in "Custom Options" tab of the corresponding outbound. See the help text in LuCI ui for the rules of configuration override.

## Changelog 2021

* 2021-01-01 feature: build Xray from source; various fixes about tproxy and logging
* 2021-01-25 feature: Xray act as HTTPS server
* 2021-01-29 fix: add ipset as dependency to fix transparent proxy problems; remove useless and faulty extra_command in init.d script
* 2021-01-29 feature: decouple with Xray original binary and data files. Use [openwrt-xray](https://github.com/yichya/openwrt-xray) instead.
* 2021-01-30 feature: select GeoIP set for direct connection. This is considered a **BREAKING** change because if unspecified, all IP addresses is forwarded through Xray.
* 2021-03-17 feature: support custom configuration files by using Xray integrated [Multiple configuration files support](https://xtls.github.io/config/features/multiple.html). Check `/var/etc/xray/config.json` for tags of generated inbounds and outbounds.
* 2021-03-20 fix: no longer be compatible with [OpenWrt Packages: xray-core](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/xray-core) because of naming conflict of configuration file and init script. Again, use
[openwrt-xray](https://github.com/yichya/openwrt-xray) instead.
* 2021-03-21 feature: detailed fallback config for Xray HTTPS server
* 2021-03-27 feature: check data files before using them. If data files don't exist, Xray will run in 'full' mode (all outgoing network traffic will be forwarded through Xray). Make sure you have a working server in this case or you have to disable Xray temporarily (SSH into your router and run `service xray stop`) for debugging. You can download data files from [Releases · XTLS/Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/xray-core/releases) or [Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat](https://github.com/Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat) and upload them to `/usr/share/xray` on your router, or just compile your firmware with data files included (recommended in most cases).
* 2021-04-02 feature: utls fingerprint (currently not available for xtls and [will be supported in Xray-core v1.5.0](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/pull/451))
* 2021-04-06 feature: customize DNS bypass rules. This is considered a **BREAKING** change because if unspecified, all DNS requests is forwarded through Xray.
* 2021-05-15 feature: add gRPC Transport settings; make init script infinite retry optional
* 2021-07-03 fix: write upstream hostname to dnsmasq configurations to avoid infinite loop while resolving upstream hostname
* 2021-08-31 feature: Accept more DNS server formats
* 2021-09-19 fix: compatible with latest dnsmasq (2.86) by adding `strict-order` to dnsmasq options generated by luci-app-xray. This should not affect compatibility with earlier dnsmasq versions (mostly 2.85) but if you encounter problems please report.
* 2021-09-26 fix: several issues related to HTTPS server
* 2021-10-01 fix: parsing default gateway in some cases
* 2021-10-06 feature: show information about asset files in LuCI; fix Xray startup when asset files are unavailable
* 2021-10-08 feature: extra DNS Server Port to reduce possibility of temporary DNS lookup failures
* 2021-10-09 fix: temporarily revert DNS over HTTPS related changes to avoid dnsmasq and iptables errors
* 2021-10-12 fix: domain based routing if sniffing is enabled
* 2021-10-19 feat: change upstream DNS resolve method to directly using Xray internal DNS server
* 2021-11-14 feat: LAN access control for transparent proxy. Devices can be set to not being transparently proxied per MAC address.
* 2021-11-15 feat: manual transparent proxy. A use case is accessing IPv6 only websites without any IPv6 address (for example, `192.0.2.1:443 -> tracker.byr.pt:443` and add hosts item `192.0.2.1 byr.pt`)
* 2021-11-20 feat: alpn settings for outbound
* 2021-11-21 fix: minor adjustments about service reloading, default DNS port, host hints, etc.
* 2021-12-16 feat: expose log and policy settings

* 2021-12-25 feat: be compatible with [OpenWrt Packages: xray-core](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/xray-core) again (by replacing its UCI configuration file and init script upon install). Still supports using [openwrt-xray](https://github.com/yichya/openwrt-xray). This should work in most cases and your previous configuration file of luci-app-xray is also preserved, but if you encounter problems please report.
* 2021-12-26 feat: support custom DNS port
